## Water Level Visualization for Vessel Docking

Monitoring water levels consists of many important factors such as under keel clearance, tide levels, and sea depth to manage large military ships to pull into port efficiently and without problem. Existing systems show water current at different times of the day but do not offer alternative ports or monitor under keel clearance for safe navigation into dockyards. In this report, we propose a new method of implementing a water level visualization system to allow ships assess when the best times to pull into dock safety would be, the system also aims to give users alternative ports available incase the required port is too dangerous or low tide, using an intuitive user interface, as assessed in our report.
